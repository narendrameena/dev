# Lesional Skin Analysis — Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook used for transcriptional,
differential expression, and time-course analysis of lesional skin samples
(day0, day3, day14). The analysis includes:

- Lesional-only subsetting  
- Cluster-level differential expression  
- Timepoint comparisons (Day3 vs Day0, Day14 vs Day3)  
- Percent-expressing calculations  
- Advanced dot plot visualisation  
- Gene set filtering and QC  

The primary notebook is stored here:
